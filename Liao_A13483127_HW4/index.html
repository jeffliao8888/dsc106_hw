        <h1>Insight into Robert Downey Jr</h1>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Data collection - The data was obtained by scraping information off of IMDB pro, which is a subscription
            service, or wikipedia. Before scraping, I checked whether the website allowed scraping.
            Web scraping was handeled in an ethically and professional manner. After scraping data from the internet,
            data was loaded into Jupyter notebook for further data cleaning. Data was prepared so that it would be easier
            to use with data visualization tools.
        </p>

        <h2>Word Cloud</h2>
        <p>
            Insight: 
            We can confirm that Robert Downey Jr's successful acting career is because of the Marvel moveis that he 
            has acted in. We can see this because from the chart below, the bigger texts are all Marvel movies.

        </p>
        <p>
            Why word cloud? At first I wanted to make a world cloud with the quotes from Robert Downey Jr.
            After trying it a few times, the chart doesn't give a lot of information. I also tried using a phrase
            cloud, but that doesn't give a lot of information too. This is because there isn't enough data.
            I later gathered box office earnings and titles of the movies that Robert Downey Jr. has acted.
            Word clouds are usually a kind of visualization that shows the frequncy a word shows up in a document
            and are used to help visualize sentiment analysis. However, in this chart I have the size of a movie
            title represent the total earnings made. Furthermore, each title is color coded by whether it is a Marvel
            movie or not.
        </p>
        <p>Technical remarks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Priming - I wanted to show that Marvel movies earned more than non-Marvel moveis so Marvel
                movies are colored green and non-Marvel movies are colored red. This is due to the same convention
                as the stock market.
            </li>
            <li>
                Legend - The legend tells whether the movie is a Marvel movie or not, i.e. green or 1 for Marvel 
                movies and red or 0 for non_Marvel movies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hovering over movie titles - When you hover over the movie titles, a tooltip will show up.
                It tells the user more information such as movie title, is it a Marvel film, and its gross income.
                The information may be redundant, but it is there to help people who can't see the smaller words
                or are having a hard time differentiating the colors apart.
            </li> 
        </ul>

        <h2>Tree map</h2>
        <p>
            Insight: We can see that Robert Downey Jr. is, unsurprisingly, most popular in North America. 
            However, he also seems to be very popular in Asia and Europe respectively.
            This conclusion is made with the assumtion that a larger box office indicates an actors popularoty. 
            This assumtion may need further investigation, but the logica makes sense because a lot of people may
            choose to watch a movie because of the movie's cast. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Why a treemap? Trying to figure where a person was popular based on the amount of box
            office is would intuitively lead to a bubble map chart, where there would be a bubble on each country
            and the bubble size would be determined by the box office. However, after trying this chart, I decided
            that it was not very appropriate as there wasn't a complete data set with all the countries. This would
            leaves a lot of empty space. I tried a tree map and though it looked better and more concise. 
        </p>
        <p>Technical Details</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Color usage - Each color represents a different continent. More details can be seen in the legend.</li>
            <li>
                Hovering over country names gives the user more information about the country name, continent, and
                gross box office. Although there may be some redundant information, the pop up tool is helpful when
                trying to get more information about countries in smaller boxes where no names are displayed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Network Map</h2>

        <p>
            Insight: Given an actor or actress, users would tend to also view other actors or actresses who have stared in 
            similar themed films. For example, given that a user loked up Robert Downey Jr, who has stared in multiple Marvel
            films, other users also looked up other stars who have stared in Marvel films.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why a network map? I want to figure out if there is a relationship betweenRobert Downey Jr. and other actors and actresses
            that other useres have looked up. It would make sense to use a network graph because we want to see relationships between
            people. Here, only the top 10 most related people that were displayed due to Miller's law, where a chart should have 5 plus or
            minus objects only. 
        </p>
        <p>Technical Details</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Size - The size of each point at the bottome represents how strongly the actor and Robert Downey Jr was
                connected. Each of the points chosen represents an actor or actress that another user also viewed given 
                that the user already viewed Robery Downey Jr's profile. For example, more people also Chris Evans given
                that they already viewed Robery Downey Jr.
            </li>
            <li>
                Hovering over the points shows a tooltip that contains the actors name. While at times, the chart
                already displays the actors and actress's names, this may not be the case when the window size changes.
                So, it is important to take into account when the the window sizes change.
            </li>
        </ul>
