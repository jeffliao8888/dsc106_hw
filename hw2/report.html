        <h3>From the Data</h2>
        <p> 
                It seems like burger sales for the past 4 years have been steady and has been increasing until Burger King introduced its Impossible burger. 
                Since the first introduction of the Impossible burger, our burger sales have taken a hit in its sales number.
                This happened accross all regions and to our hamburgers, chicken fillet, and fish fillet.
                However, there is no need to panic. 
                Our burger sales have risen immediately the next month, which shows that customers are still inclined to buy our burgers no matter the competition. 
        </p>

        <h2>Sales by Days of Week</h2>
        <p>The following 3 charts are graphed by total sale of each type of burger on a day of the week in January 2016.</p>
        <p>The last chart is total sale of all the burgers combined by a day of week in January 2016.</p>
        <p>
            These sales figures have no close connection with the impact done from Burger King's Impossible burger,
            but they may provide insight on how we devise strategic promotion events.
        </p>
        <div id="chicken"></div>
        <div id="fish"></div>
        <div id="hamburger"></div>
        <div id="burger"></div>
        <h3>From the Data</h3>
        <p>
            Out of the chicken fillet, fish fillet, and the hamburger, both the chicken fillet and the hamburger
            have high sales on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. From the chart that aggregates all the
            burger sales, it still seems like Friday, Saturday, and Sunday have high sale figures. 
            Therefore, we should make a strategy to boost burger sales on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
            We could try to push promotions on those other burgers. Furthermore, the fish fillet seems to be lagging in sales.
            We should also try to increase sales for the fish fillet, since it is one of our legacy menu items.

        <h2>What Now?</h2>
        <p>
            Our burgers are among the best in the world. Our customers choose McDonald's for a reason. We have
            created a culture. Although our competitor, Burger King, tried to form a new line of burgers to ramp 
            up the competition, our burger sales figure has only been impacted for a month. The following month
            our burger sales recouped. Therefore, we do not have to feel anxious about their Impossible burgers.
            Furthermore, I recommend that we try to increase burger sales on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, adn Thursday
            by push promotions through commercials or our mobile app. Overall, we are doing great.
